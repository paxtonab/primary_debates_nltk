# 2016 Presidential Primary Debates Text Analysis
A basic python script to parse transcripts of the 2016 Presidential Primary Debates into csv's that can be used for further text analysis.
## Overview
Uses built in python types to transform the raw text and total some basic aggregations. Uses the NLTK to create basic frequency distributions and get unique words spoken per debate and overall.
## TODO:
1. Add in Democratic presidential candidates
2. Integrate with SQLAlchemy to load parsed text into a database
3. Attempt machine learning classification and topic extraction
